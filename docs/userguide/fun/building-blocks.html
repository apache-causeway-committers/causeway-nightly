<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section we run through the main building blocks that make up an Apache Isis application.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="metamodel"><a class="anchor" href="#metamodel"></a>A MetaModel</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At its core, Apache Isis is a metamodel that is built at runtime from the domain classes (eg <code>Customer.java</code>), along with optional supporting metadata (eg <code>Customer.layout.xml</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The contents of this metamodel is inferred from the Java classes discovered on the classpath: the entities and supporting services, as well the members of those classes.
The detail of the metamodel is generally explicit, usually represented by Java annotations such as <code>@Title</code> or <code>@Action</code>.
Notably the metamodel is <a href="../btb/programming-model.html" class="page">extensible</a>; it is possible to teach Apache Isis new programming conventions/rules (and conversely to remove those that are built in).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the annotations recognized by the framework are defined by the Apache Isis framework itself.
For example the <code>@Title</code> annotation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which identifies how the framework should derive a human-readable label for each rendered domain object&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;is part of the <code>org.apache.isis.applib.annotations</code> package.
However the framework also recognizes certain other JEE annotations such as <code>@javax.inject.Inject</code> (used for dependency injection).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The framework uses DataNucleus for its persistence mechanism.
This is an ORM that implements the JDO and JPA APIs, and which can map domain objects either to an RDBMS or to various NoSQL objectstores such as MongoDB or Neo4J.
Apache Isis recognizes a number of the JDO annotations such as <code>@javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull=&#8230;&#8203;)</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, the framework builds up the metamodel for each domain object using
<a href="../../vw/layout.html" class="page">layout hints</a>, such as <code>Customer.layout.xml</code>.
These provide metadata such as grouping elements of the UI together, using multi-column layouts, and so on.
The layout file can be modified while the application is still running, and are picked up automatically; a useful way to speed up feedback.</p>

<h2 id="type-of-domain-objects"><a class="anchor" href="#type-of-domain-objects"></a>Type of Domain Objects</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apache Isis supports recognises four main types of domain classes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>domain entities</strong> - domain objects persisted to the database using JDO/DataNucleus; for example <code>Customer</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>domain services</strong> - generally singletons, automatically injected, and providing various functionality; for example <code>CustomerRepository</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>view models</strong> - domain objects that are a projection of some state held by the database, in support a particular use case; for example <code>CustomerDashboard</code> (to pull together commonly accessed information about a customer).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>mixins</strong> - allow functionality to be "contributed" in the UI by one module to another object, similar to traits or extension methods provided in some programming languages.
This is an important capability to help keep large applications decoupled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the end-user&#8217;s perspective the UI displays a single domain object instance that has state (that is, a domain entity or a view model) per page.
The end-user can then inspect and modify its state, and navigate to related objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Domain classes are generally recognized using annotations.
Apache Isis defines its own set of annotations, while entities are annotated using JDO/DataNucleus (though XML can also be used if required).
Apache Isis recognizes some of the JDO and JAXB annotations and infers domain semantics from these annotations.
Similarly, JAXB annotations are typically used for view models.
There is a smattering of other Java/JEE annotations that are also supported, such as <code>@javax.inject.Inject</code> and <code>@javax.annotation.Nullable</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following subsections explain this in further detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="domain-entities"><a class="anchor" href="#domain-entities"></a>Domain Entities</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most domain objects that the end-user interacts with are <em>domain entities</em>, such as <code>Customer</code>, <code>Order</code>, <code>Product</code> and so on.
These are persistent objects and which are mapped to a database (usually relational), using JDO/DataNucleus annotations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some domain entities are really aggregates, a combination of multiple objects.
A commonly cited example of this is an <code>Order</code>, which really consists of both a root <code>Order</code> entity and a collection of <code>OrderItem</code>s.
From the end-users' perspective, when they talk of "order" they almost always mean the aggregate rather than just the <code>Order</code> root entity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eric Evans' <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Domain_Driven_Design.html?id=hHBf4YxMnWMC">Domain Driven Design</a> has a lot to say about aggregate roots and their responsibilities: in particular that it is the responsibility of the aggregate root to maintain the invariants of its component pieces, and that roots may only reference other roots.
There&#8217;s good logic here: requiring only root-to-root relationships reduces the number of moving parts that the developer has to think about.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, this constraint can substantially complicate matters when mapping domain layer to the persistence layer.
DDD tends to de-emphasise such matters: it aims to be completely agnostic about the persistence layer, with the responsibilities for managing relationships moved (pretty much by definition) into the domain layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a framework Apache Isis is less dogmatic about such things.
Generally the domain objects are mapped to a relational database and so we can lean on the referential integrity capabilities of the persistence layer to maintain referential invariants.
Said another way: we don&#8217;t tend to require that only roots can maintain roots: we don&#8217;t see anything wrong in an <code>InvoiceItem</code> referencing an <code>OrderItem</code>, for example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nonetheless the concepts of "aggregate" and "aggregate root" are worth holding onto.
You&#8217;ll probably find yourself defining a repository service (discussed in more detail below) for each aggregate root: for example <code>Order</code> will have a corresponding <code>OrderRepository</code> service.
Similarly, you may also have a factory service, for example <code>OrderFactory</code>.
However, you are less likely to have a repository service for the parts of an aggregate root: the role of retrieving <code>OrderItem</code>s should fall to the <code>Order</code> root (typically by way of lazy loading of an "items" collection) rather than through an <code>OrderItemRepository</code> service.
This isn&#8217;t a hard-n-fast rule, but it is a good rule of thumb.</p>

Domain services consist of a set of logically grouped actions, and as such follow the same conventions as for entities.
However, a service cannot have (persisted) properties, nor can it have (persisted) collections.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A very common type of domain service is a repository, that is used to look up existing instances of a domain entity.
For example, for the <code>Customer</code> entity there may be a <code>CustomerRepository</code>, while for <code>Order</code> entity there may be an <code>OrderRepository</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, entities might also have a corresponding factory service: a <code>CustomerFactory</code> or an <code>OrderFactory</code>; Evans' <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Domain_Driven_Design.html?id=hHBf4YxMnWMC">Domain Driven Design</a>, draws a clear distinction between a factory (that creates object) and a repository (that is used to find existing objects).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, from an end-users' perspective the act of finding an existing object vs creating a new one are quite closely related.
For this reason, in Apache Isis it&#8217;s therefore quite common to have a single domain service that acts as both a factory and a repository (and is usually called just a "repository").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The behaviour of these services is rendered in various ways, though the most obvious is as the menu actions on the top-level menu bars in the <a href="../../vw/about.html" class="page">Wicket viewer</a>'s UI.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Domain services can also be used for a number of other purposes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>to provide additional non-UI functionality; an example being to perform an address geocoding lookup against the google-maps API, or to perform some calculation, or attach a barcode, send an email etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to act as a subscribers to the event bus, potentially influencing events fired by some other module (a key technique for decoupling large applications)<br></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is discussed in more detail below, in the section on <a href="#events">events</a>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>to implement an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_provider_interface">SPI</a> of the Apache Isis framework, most notably cross-cutting concerns such as security, command profiling, auditing and publishing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Domain objects of any type (entities, other services, view models, mixins) can also delegate to domain services; domain services are automatically injected into every other domain object.
This injection of domain services into entities is significant: it allows business logic to be implemented in the domain entities, rather than have it "leach away" into
supporting service layers.
Said another way: it is the means by which Apache Isis helps you avoid the anaemic domain model anti-pattern.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Domain services are instantiated once and once only by the framework, and are used to centralize any domain logic that does not logically belong in a domain entity or value.</p>

<p>The (non-ASF) <a href="https://platform.incode.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Incode Platform</a> provide SPI implementations of the common cross-cutting concerns.
They also provide a number of APIs for domain objects to invoke (not shown in the diagram).
You can also write your own domain services as well, for example to interface with some external CMS system, say.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="view-models"><a class="anchor" href="#view-models"></a>View Models</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>View models are similar to entities in that (unlike domain services) there can be many instances of any given type.
End users interact with view models in the same way as a domain entity, indeed they are unlikely to distinguish one from the other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, whereas domain entities are mapped to a datastore, view models are not.
Instead they are recreated dynamically by serializing their state, ultimately into the URL itself (meaning their state it is in effect implicitly managed by the client browser).
You will notice that the URL for view models (as shown in <a href="../../vw/about.html" class="page">Wicket viewer</a> or <a href="../../vro/about.html" class="page">RestfulObjects viewer</a>) tends to be quite long.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This capability opens up a number of more advanced use cases:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the same way that an (RDBMS) database view can aggregate and abstract from multiple underlying database tables, a view model sits on top of one or many underlying entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A view model could also be used as a proxy for some externally managed entity, accessed over a web service or REST API; it could even be a representation of state held in-memory (such as user preferences, for example).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>view models can also be used to support a particular use case.
An example that comes to mind is to expose a list of scanned PDFs to be processed as an "intray", showing the list of PDFs on one side of the page, and the current PDF being viewed on the other.
Such view models are part of the application layer, not part of the domain layer (where entities live).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="externally-managed-entities"><a class="anchor" href="#externally-managed-entities"></a>Externally-managed entities</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes the entities that make up your application are persisted not in the local database but reside in some other system, for example accessible only through a SOAP web service.
Logically that data might still be considered a domain entity and we might want to associate behaviour with it, however it cannot be modelled as a domain entity if only because JDO/DataNucleus doesn&#8217;t know about the entity nor how to retrieve or update it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a couple of ways around this: we could either replicate the data somehow from the external system into the Isis-managed database (in which case it is once again just another domain entity), or we could set up a stub/proxy for the externally managed entity.
This proxy would hold the reference to the externally-managed domain entity (eg an external id), as well as the "smarts" to know how to interact with that entity (by making SOAP web service calls etc).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The stub/proxy is a type of view model: a view&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;if you like&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;onto the domain entity managed by the external system.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="in-memory-entities"><a class="anchor" href="#in-memory-entities"></a>In-memory entities</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a variation on the above, sometimes there are domain objects that are, conceptually at least entities, but whose state is not actually persisted anywhere, merely held in-memory (eg in a hash).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A simple example might be read-only configuration data that is read from a config file (eg log4j appender definitions) but thereafter is presented in the UI just like any other entity.</p>

<h4 id="application-layer-view-models"><a class="anchor" href="#application-layer-view-models"></a>Application-layer view models</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Domain entities (whether locally persisted or managed externally) are the bread-and-butter of Apache Isis applications: the focus after all, should be on the business domain concepts and ensuring that they are solid.
Generally those domain entities will make sense to the business domain experts: they form the <em>ubiquitous language</em> of the domain.
These domain entities are part of the domain layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That said, it may not always be practical to expect end-users of the application to interact solely with those domain entities.
For example, it may be useful to show a dashboard of the most significant data in the system to a user, often pulling in and aggregating information from multiple points of the app.
Obtaining this information by hand (by querying the respective services/repositories) would be tedious and slow; far better to have a dashboard do the job for the end user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A dashboard object is a model of the most relevant state to the end-user, in other words it is (quite literally) a view model.
 It is not a persisted entity, instead it belongs to the application layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A view model need not merely aggregate data; it could also provide actions of its own.
Most likely these actions will be queries and will always ultimately just delegate down to the appropriate domain-layer service/repository.
But in some cases such view model actions might also modify state of underlying domain entities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another common use for view models is to help co-ordinate complex business processes; for example to perform a quarterly invoicing run, or to upload annual interest rates from an Excel spreadsheet.
In these cases the view model might have some state of its own, but in most cases that state does not need to be persisted per se.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">Desire Lines</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One way to think of application view models is as modelling the "desire line": the commonly-trod path that end-users must follow to get from point A to point B as quickly as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To explain: there are <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/62599/Where-the-sidewalk-ends">documented</a> <a href="https://sivers.org/walkways">examples</a> <a href="http://www.softpanorama.org/People/Wall/larry_wall_articles_and_interviews.shtml">that</a> architects of university campus will only add in paths some while after the campus buildings are complete: let the pedestrians figure out the routes they want to take.
The name we like best for this idea is "desire lines", though it has also been called a "desire path", "paving the path" or "paving the sidewalk".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What that means is you should add view models <em>after</em> having built up the domain layer, rather than before.
These view models pave that commonly-trod path, automating the steps that the end-user would otherwise have to do by hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It takes a little practice though, because even when building the domain layer "first", you should still bear in mind what the use cases are that those domain entities are trying to support.
You certainly <em>shouldn&#8217;t</em> try to build out a domain layer that could support every conceivable use case before starting to think about view models.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, you should iterate.
Identify the use case/story/end-user objective that will deliver value to the business.
Then build out the minimum domain entities to support that use case.
Then, identify if there any view models that could be introduced which would simplify the end-user interactions with the system (perhaps automating several related use cases together).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When developing an Apache Isis application you will most likely start off with the persistent domain entities: <code>Customer</code>, <code>Order</code>, <code>Product</code>, and so on.
For some applications this may well suffice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, if the application needs to integrate with other systems, or if the application needs to support reasonably complex business processes, then you may need to look beyond just domain entities; view models are the tool of choice.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="dtos"><a class="anchor" href="#dtos"></a>DTOs</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DTOs (data transfer objects) are simple classes that (according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object">wikipedia</a>) "carry data between processes".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If those two processes are parts of the same overall application (the same team builds and deploys both server and client) then there&#8217;s generally no need to define a DTO; just access the entities using Apache Isis' <a href="../../vro/about.html" class="page">RestfulObjects viewer</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, if the client consuming the DTO is a different application&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;by which we mean developed/deployed by a different (possible third-party) team&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;then the DTOs act as a formal contract between the provider and the consumer.
In such cases, exposing domain entities over <a href="../../vro/about.html" class="page">RestfulObjects</a> would be "A Bad Thing"&#8482; because the consumer would in effect have access to implementation details that could then not be easily changed by the producer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To support this use case, a view model can be defined such that it can act as a DTO.
This is done by annotating the class using JAXB annotations; this allows the consumer to obtain the DTO in XML format along with a corresponding XSD schema describing the structure of that XML.
A discussion of how that might be done using an ESB such as <a href="http://camel.apache.org">Apache Camel&#8482;</a> follows <a href="#view-models#dtos_consumers">below</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In case it&#8217;s not obvious, these DTOs are still usable as "regular" view models; they will render in the <a href="../../vw/about.html" class="page">Wicket viewer</a> just like any other.
In fact (as the <a href="programming-model.html#jaxb" class="page">programming model</a> section below makes clear), these JAXB-annotated view models are in many regards the most powerful of all the alternative ways of writing view models.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that it is also possible to download the XML (or XSD) straight from the UI, useful during development.
The view model simply needs to implement the <a href="../../refguide/applib-cm/classes/mixins.html#Dto" class="page"><code>Dto</code></a> marker interface; the framework has <a href="../../refguide/applib-cm/classes/mixins.html#Dto" class="page">mixins</a> that contribute the download actions to the view model.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="../../vro/about.html" class="page">Restful Objects</a> viewer automatically provides a REST API for both domain entities.
Or, you can use it to only expose view models, taking care to map the state of the domain entity/ies into a view model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Which beckons the question: when is it safe to safe to expose domain entities directly as REST resources, and when should view models be exposed instead.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you go searching google you&#8217;ll find plenty of discussion on this topic (eg <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36174516/rest-api-dtos-or-not">here</a> and <a href="https://juristr.com/blog/2012/10/lessions-learned-dont-expose-ef-entities-to-the-client-directly/">here</a>).
Almost all of these recommend exposing only DTOs (which is to say view models), not domain entities, in REST APIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not so fast, though: the real question is whether the REST API you are exposing is a public API or an internal private API.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If it&#8217;s a public API, which is to say that there are third-party clients out over which you have no control, then view models are the way to go.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case view models provide an isolation layer which allow you to modify the structure of the underlying domain entities without breaking this API.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it&#8217;s a private API, which is to say that the only clients of the REST API are under your  control, then view models are an unnecessary overhead.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, just expose domain entities directly.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The caveat to the "private API" option is that private APIs have a habit of becoming public APIs.
Even if the REST API is only exposed within your organisation&#8217;s intranet, other teams may "discover" your REST API and start writing applications that consume it.
If that REST API is exposing domain entities, you could easily break those other teams' clients if you refactor.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your REST API is intended to be public (or you can&#8217;t be sure that it will remain private), the exposing view models will entail a lot of marshalling of state from domain entities into view models.
There are numerous open source tools that can help with that, for example <a href="http://modelmapper.org/">Model Mapper</a>, <a href="http://dozer.sourceforge.net/">Dozer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/orika-mapper/orika">Orika</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Or, rather than marshalling state, the view model could hold a reference to the underlying domain entity/ies and dynamically read from it (ie, all the view model&#8217;s properties are derived from the entity&#8217;s).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A third option is to define an RDBMS view, and then map a "non-durable" entity to that view.
The RDBMS view then becomes the public API that must be preserved.
The DataNucleus documents <a href="http://www.datanucleus.org:15080/products/accessplatform_5_1/jdo/mapping.html#schema_rdbms_views">describe</a> how to create non-durable views; a "real-world" example can also be found <a href="https://github.com/estatio/estatio/blob/rel/tag-1.20.20171025-1442/estatioapp/module/lease/dom/src/main/java/org/estatio/dom/lease/invoicing/viewmodel/InvoiceSummaryForInvoiceRun.java#L53">here</a> (in Estatio).</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="mixins"><a class="anchor" href="#mixins"></a>Mixins</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The final type of domain object is the <strong>mixin</strong>.
These are similar to traits or extension methods in other programming languages, in that they contribute (or rather, mixin) both behaviour or (derived) state to entities/view models.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A mixin object allows one class to contribute behaviour - actions, (derived) properties and (derived) collections - to another domain object, either a domain entity or view model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This allows the app to stay decoupled, so that it doesn&#8217;t degrade into the proverbial <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">"big ball of mud"</a>.
Mixins allow dependencies to be inverted, so that the dependencies between modules can be kept acyclic and under control.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the contributee (eg <code>Customer</code>, being mixed into) is in one module, while the contributor mixin (<code>DocumentHolder_documents</code>) is in some other module.
The <code>customer</code> module knows about the <code>document</code> module, but not vice versa.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mixins are also a convenient mechanism for grouping functionality even for a concrete type, helping to rationalize about the dependency between the data and the behaviour.
Each mixin is in effect a single behavioural "responsibility" of the domain object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, we find mixins nicely balance inside-out vs outside-in ways of thinking about a system:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>inside-out tends to focus on the structure, the nouns that make up the domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>outside-in tends to focus on the behaviour, that is the functionality that the system provides to automate the business processes; the verbs, in other words.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, while Apache Isis allows you to put behaviour onto the underlying domain entities, it can often be better to treat the domain entities as immutable.
Instead, use mixins to implement behaviour.
When using agile development methodology, it&#8217;s common for a user story to correspond to a new mixin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are also practical reasons for moving behaviour out of entities even within the same module, because structuring your application this way helps support hot-reloading of Java classes (so that you can modify and recompile your application without having to restart it).
This can provide substantial productivity gains.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Hotspot JVM has limited support for hot reloading; generally you can change method implementations but you cannot introduce new methods.
However, the <a href="https://dcevm.github.io/">DCEVM</a> open source project will patch the JVM to support much more complete hot reloading support.
There are also, of course, commercial products such as JRebel.</p>

<p>Mixins are an implementation of the <a href="http://www.artima.com/articles/dci_vision.html">DCI architecture</a> architecture, as formulated and described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trygve_Reenskaug">Trygve Reenskaug</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Coplien">Jim Coplien</a>.
Reenskaug was the inventor of the MVC pattern (and also the external examiner for Richard Pawson&#8217;s <a href="../../../../../ug/fun/_attachments/core-concepts/Pawson-Naked-Objects-thesis.pdf">PhD thesis</a>), while Coplien has a long history in object-orientation, C++ and patterns.</p>

<p>The Apache Isis framework actively tracks the identity of each domain object.
This identity is represented to the end-user in human-readable form so that they know which object they are interacting with, and is also used and is available internally/for integrations.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section explores these two related concepts.</p>

<h3 id="title-and-icon-and-css-class"><a class="anchor" href="#title-and-icon-and-css-class"></a>Title, Icon and CSS Class</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To allow the end-user to distinguish one domain object from another, it is rendered with a title and an icon.
The icon informally identifies the type of the domain object, while the title identifies the instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="title"><a class="anchor" href="#title"></a>Title</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The title of a domain object is shown in several places: as the main heading for an object; as a link text or tooltip for an object referencing another object, and also in tables representing collections of objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The title is not formally required to be a unique identify the object within its type, but it needs to be "unique enough" that a human user is able to distinguish one instance from another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The title is usually just a simple string, but the framework also allows for the title to be translated into different locales.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="icon"><a class="anchor" href="#icon"></a>Icon</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s helpful for the icon to represent more than just the object&#8217;s type; it might also indicate the state of an object.
For example, a shipped <code>Order</code> might have a slightly different icon to a yet-to-be-shipped <code>Order</code>; or a library book that is <code>loaned out</code> might be distinguished from one that is <code>available</code>.</p>

<h4 id="css-class"><a class="anchor" href="#css-class"></a>CSS Class</h4>

<p>In addition to the title and icon, it is also possible for a domain object to provide a CSS class hint.
In conjunction with <a href="../../vw/customisation.html#tweaking-css-classes" class="page">customized CSS</a> this can be used to apply arbitrary styling; for example each object could be rendered in a page with a different background colour.</p>

<p>As well as defining a <a href="#metamodel">metamodel</a> of the structure (domain classes) of its domain objects, Apache Isis also manages the runtime instances of said domain objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a domain entity is recreated from the database, the framework keeps track of its identity through an "OID": an object identifier.
Fundamentally this is a combination of its type (domain class), along with an identifier.
You can think of it as its "primary key", except across all domain entity types.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For portability and resilience, though, the object type is generally an alias for the actual domain class: thus "customers.CUS", say, rather than "com.mycompany.myapp.customers.Customer".
This is derived from an annotation.
The identifier meanwhile is always converted to a string.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although simple, the OID is an enormously powerful concept: it represents a URI to any domain object managed by a given Apache Isis application.
With it, we have the ability to lookup any arbitrary domain objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some examples:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>an OID allows sharing of information between users, eg as a deep link to be pasted into an email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the information within an OID could be converted into a barcode, and stamped onto a PDF form.
When the PDF is scanned by the mail room, the barcode could be read to attach the correspondence to the relevant domain object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a handle to any object in an audit record, as used by <a href="../../refguide/applib-svc/persistence-layer-spi/AuditerService.html" class="page"><code>AuditerService</code></a>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>similarly within implementations of <a href="../../refguide/applib-svc/application-layer-spi/CommandService.html" class="page"><code>CommandService</code></a> to persist <code>Command</code> objects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>similarly within implementations of <a href="../../refguide/applib-svc/persistence-layer-spi/PublisherService.html" class="page"><code>PublisherService</code></a> to persist published action invocations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and of course both the <a href="../../vro/about.html" class="page">RestfulObjects viewer</a> and <a href="../../vw/about.html" class="page">Wicket viewer</a> use the oid tuple to look up, render and allow the user to interact with domain objects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although the exact content of an OID should be considered opaque by domain objects, it is possible for domain objects to obtain OIDs.
These are represented as <code>Bookmark</code>s, obtained from the <a href="../../refguide/applib-svc/integration-api/BookmarkService.html" class="page"><code>BookmarkService</code></a>.
Deep links meanwhile can be obtained from the <a href="../../refguide/applib-svc/presentation-layer-api/DeepLinkService.html" class="page"><code>`DeepLinkService</code></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OIDs can also be converted into XML format, useful for integration scenarios.
The <a href="../../refguide/schema/common.html" class="page">common schema</a> XSD defines the <code>oidDto</code> complex type for precisely this purpose.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="object-members"><a class="anchor" href="#object-members"></a>Object Members</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every domain object in Apache Isis consists of (at most) three types of members:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>properties, such as a <code>Customer</code>'s <code>firstName</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>collections, such as a <code>Customer</code>'s <code>orders</code> collection of <code>Order</code>s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>actions, such as a <code>Customer'</code>s <code>placeOrder(&#8230;&#8203;)</code> method.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, mixins act as contributors of behaviour to an underlying domain object.
Typically the behaviour being contributed is an action, but it could also be a derived property or a derived collection.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="properties"><a class="anchor" href="#properties"></a>Properties</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Properties follow the standard getter/setter pattern, with the return type being a scalar (a value object or another entity or view model).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example (using <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/GetterSetter">Project Lombok</a> to avoid some boilerplate), with:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">public class Customer
    @Getter @Setter
    private String lastName;
    ...
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>the framework infers the <code>Customer</code> domain entity, which in turn has a <code>firstName</code> string <em>property</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="collections"><a class="anchor" href="#collections"></a>Collections</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Collections are also represented by a getter and setter, however the return type is a <code>Collection</code> or subtype.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example (again, using <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/GetterSetter">Project Lombok</a>), with:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">public class Customer
    @Getter @Setter
    private SortedSet&lt;Order&gt; orders = new TreeSet&lt;Order&gt;();
    ...
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>the framework infers the <code>orders</code> <em>collection</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock tip">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-tip" title="Tip"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most commonly used collection type is <code>java.util.SortedSet</code>; entities are most commonly mapped to a relational database (ie a datastore with set semantics) and we recommend that all entities define a natural ordering so that when rendered in the UI they will be ordered "meaningfully" to the end-user.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="actions"><a class="anchor" href="#actions"></a>Actions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The third type of object member is actions.
(To a first approximation), actions are all public methods that do not represent properties or collections.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">public class Customer
    public Customer placeOrder(Product p, int quantity) { /* ... */ }
    ...
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>corresponds to the <code>placeOrder</code> <em>action</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above <em>is</em> a simplification; the Apache Isis programming model also recognizes a number of other supporting methods each of which has its own prefix such as <code>hide</code>, <code>disable</code> or <code>validate</code>.
These can be considered as "reserved words" in Apache Isis, and do <em>not</em> correspond to actions even though they have public visibility.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="events"><a class="anchor" href="#events"></a>Events</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the framework renders a domain object, and as the end-user interacts with the domain object, the framework it emits multiple events using the intra-process <a href="../../refguide/applib-svc/core-domain-api/EventBusService.html" class="page">event bus</a>.
These events enable other domain services (possibly in other modules) to influence how the domain object is rendered, or to perform side-effects or even veto an action invocation.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock tip">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-tip" title="Tip"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is also possible to simulate the rendering of a domain object by way of the <a href="../../refguide/applib-svc/application-layer-api/WrapperFactory.html" class="page"><code>WrapperFactory</code></a>.
This allows business rules to be enforced for programmatic interactions between objects.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To receive the events, the domain service should subscribe to the <a href="../../refguide/applib-svc/core-domain-api/EventBusService.html" class="page"><code>EventBusService</code></a>, and implement an appropriately annotated method to receive the events.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The framework has several categories of events: domain events, UI events and lifecycle events.
These are explored in the sections below.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="domain-events"><a class="anchor" href="#domain-events"></a>Domain Events</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Domain events are fired&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;through the internal <a href="../../refguide/applib-svc/core-domain-api/EventBusService.html" class="page">event bus</a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for every user interaction with each object member (property, collection or action).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, rendering a property causes a <code>PropertyDomainEvent</code> to be fired, though the <a href="../../refguide/applib-ant/Property.html#domainEvent" class="page"><code>@Property#domainEvent()</code></a> attribute allows a custom subclass to be specified if necessary.
Similarly, rendering a collection causes a <code>CollectionDomainEvent</code> to be fired, and rendering an action causes an <code>ActionDomainEvent</code> to be fired.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, each event can be fired up to five times, with the event&#8217;s <code>getEventPhase()</code> method indicating to the subscriber the phase:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>hide</strong> phase allows the subscriber to hide the member</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>disable</strong> phase allows the subscriber to disable the member.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a property this makes it read-only; for an action this makes it "greyed out".
(Collections are implicitly read-only).</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>validate</strong> phase allows the subscriber to validate the proposed change.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a property this means validating the proposed new value of the property; for an action this means validating the action parameter arguments.
For example, a referential integrity restrict could be implemented here.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>executing</strong> phase is prior to the actual property edit/action invocation, allowing the subscriber to perform side-effects.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, a cascade delete could be implemented here.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>executed</strong> phase is after the actual property edit/action invocation.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, a business audit event could be implemented here.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For more details on the actual domain event classes, see the <a href="../../refguide/applib-cm/classes/domainevent.html" class="page">domain event</a> section of the relevant reference guide.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="ui-events"><a class="anchor" href="#ui-events"></a>UI Events</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As explained <a href="#title-and-icon-and-css-class">earlier</a>, to allow the end-user to distinguish one domain object from another, it is rendered with a title and an icon.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="ui-hints/object-titles-and-icons.html" class="page">Normally</a> the code to return title and icon of an object is part of the domain object&#8217;s implementation.
However, UI events allow this title and icon to be provided instead by a subscriber.
UI events have higher precedence than the other mechanisms of supplying a title.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If annotated with <a href="../../refguide/applib-ant/DomainObjectLayout.html#titleUiEvent" class="page"><code>@DomainObjectLayout#titleUiEvent()</code></a>, the appropriate (subclass of) <code>TitleUiEvent</code> will be emitted.
 Similarly for <a href="../../refguide/applib-ant/DomainObjectLayout.html#iconUiEvent" class="page"><code>iconUiEvent()</code></a> and <a href="../../refguide/applib-ant/DomainObjectLayout.html#cssClassUiEvent" class="page"><code>cssClassUiEvent()</code></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can be particularly useful for <a href="programming-model.html#jaxb" class="page">JAXB-style view models</a> which are code generated from XSDs and so cannot have any dependencies on the rest of the Apache Isis framework.
Here a subscriber on the default events can provide a title and icon for such an object.
Behaviour on such DTOs can also be provided using <a href="#mixins">mixins</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Events also allow one module to influence/fine-tune the title of entities provided by some other module.
One such case is when reusing library modules, eg as provided by (non-ASF) <a href="https://platform.incode.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Incode Platform</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="lifecycle-events"><a class="anchor" href="#lifecycle-events"></a>Lifecycle Events</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lifecycle events allow domain object subscribers to listen for changes to the persistence state of domain entities, and act accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lifecycle events are <em>not</em> fired for view models.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The lifecycle events supported are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>object created - just instantiated.<br></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that this requires that the object is instantiated using the framework, see <a href="crud/instantiating.html" class="page">here</a> for further discussion</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>updated loaded - just retrieved from the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>object persisting - object about to be inserted into the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>object persisted - object just inserted into the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>object updating - object about to be updated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>object updated - object just updated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>object removing - object about to be deleted from the database</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no lifecycle event for object creating because the framework doesn&#8217;t know about newly created objects until they have been created; and there is no lifecycle event for obejcts removed because it is not valid to "touch" a domain entity once deleted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if annotated with <a href="../../refguide/applib-ant/DomainObject.html#updatingLifecycleEvent" class="page"><code>@DomainObjectLayout#updatingLifecycleEvent()</code></a>, the appropriate (subclass of) <code>ObjectUpdatingEvent</code> will be emitted.
 Similarly for <a href="../../refguide/applib-ant/DomainObjectLayout.html#iconUiEvent" class="page"><code>iconUiEvent()</code></a> and <a href="../../refguide/applib-ant/DomainObjectLayout.html#cssClassUiEvent" class="page"><code>cssClassUiEvent()</code></a>.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="modules"><a class="anchor" href="#modules"></a>Modules</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We tend to use Maven modules as a way to group related domain objects together; we can then reason about all the classes in that module as a single unit.
By convention there will be a single top-level package corresponding to the module.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the (non-ASF) <a href="https://platform.incode.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Incode Platform</a>'s <a href="http://platform.incode.org/modules/lib/excel/lib-excel.html">Excel</a> module has a top-level package of <code>org.incode.module.excel</code>.
Within the module there may be various subpackages, but it&#8217;s the module that defines the namespace.</p>
